## Usage

Enter a new burger name in the "Add A Burger" section. The new burger will be written to the database then displayed to the page under the "Burgers Fresh Off The Grill" section. These Burgers can then be "Devoured" and are updated as such in the database then moved to the "Burgers that Have Been Devoured" section.

 When thye page is loaded, a burger is created, or updated (devoured), an ajax request is made from the front end and is received by a controller which queries the database utilizing the respective SQL queries.
